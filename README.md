# CodeDex Python Checkpoint Project

## Description
This is a Python project implementing a Shape Area Calculator. The calculator allows users to calculate the area of different shapes such as Square, Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `calculator.py` script using Python.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a shape and provide the required input values.
5. The program will calculate and display the area of the chosen shape.

## Features
- Calculates the area of four different shapes: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle.
- User-friendly menu interface for selecting the shape to calculate.
- Accepts user input for necessary parameters like side length, width, height, base, and radius.
- Provides accurate area calculation based on the chosen shape's formula.
